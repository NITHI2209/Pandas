Pandas Definition:
Pandas is a powerful open-source Python library used for data analysis and data manipulation.
It provides easy-to-use tools to work with structured data, especially tables (rows and columns).

Key points:
1)Built on top of Python and NumPy
2)Used to handle Excel-like or SQL-like data
3)Allows reading data from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.
4)Provides two main data structures:
         1) Series → 1-dimensional data (like a column)(either string or int) (sizeimmutable-alteration can be done but it will consider as new series not on original one )
            NOTE: If one value is converted into string then all values of the coulumn will be converted into string 
         2) DataFrame → 2-dimensional data (like a table)  (hetergenous - int in one column , string in one column, sizemutable - any rows or columns can be deleted or altered)

why pandas:
1)Import datasets
2)Data cleaning
3)Size mutability
4)Reshapning and pivoting of datasets
5)Efficient Manipulation and extraction
6) Stastistical analysis
